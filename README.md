Simple Kramer's Kronig implementation using 
MacLaurin's numerical integration method;
Shown to have lowest error for this type of problem. 
(Odd, since it seems like a poor method, but whatever.)

For reference, see: 
Applied Spectroscopy, Vol. 42, Issue 6, pp. 952-957 (1988)
(I have not yet found any other reference to this method...)
